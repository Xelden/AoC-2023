# AoC 2023 C++

You can check big boys [here.](https://bigboy.wiki/) (They're too big for GitHub).

## Annotations

- Day 5: part 1 uses blatant brute force. Therefore, it takes quite a while to run. Part 2 doesn't, so it runs almost instantly. The latter doesn't work on the bigboy, probably because some edge case I didn't account for. Maybe I'll fix it someday.

- Day 6: none of the parts work on the bigboy because I didn't want to deal with such large numbers.
